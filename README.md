## ðŸ“Š Datasets:
- Stock prices and daily returns  
- Cryptocurrency prices and returns  
- Breast cancer dataset (healthcare)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

In this hands-on project, I explored the fundamentals of **data visualization using Python**.
I worked extensively with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, two of the most powerful visualization libraries in Python. 
I applied these tools within a Jupyter Notebook environment to visually analyze datasets from the financial and healthcare domains.

Throughout this project, I created a variety of visualizations, including:
- Line plots
- Scatterplots
- Histograms
- Distribution plots
- Countplots
- Pairplots
- 3D scatterplots
- Pie charts
- Heatmaps

Each visualization helped me uncover trends, patterns, and correlations within the data. 
This was particularly useful when comparing stock and crypto returns, or identifying class distributions and feature relationships in the breast cancer dataset.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

- Visualized data using histograms, countplots, scatterplots, and line plots  
- Mastered how to customize charts with titles, labels, grid lines, and colors  
- Learned to build multi-plot layouts and subplots  
- Applied 3D plotting with `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d`  
- Understood the core functionality of Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Strengthened my Python programming and data analysis skills through visualization
